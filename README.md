* **Fast, type-safe tool calling** — automatically generates structured grammars from your function signatures, no schema writing needed
* **Multimodal input** — provide image and audio information to your LLM
* **Text-to-speech** — synthesize local WAV audio with Kokoro, Pocket TTS and Supertonic backends
* **Speech-to-text** — Transcribe audio into text with Whisper
* **Model downloading** — load models directly from [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/models?library=gguf&sort=trending) or any URL

## ⚡️ Under the Hood

* Conversation-aware preemptive context shifting — retain full conversation memory without any message length limits
* GPU-accelerated inference via Vulkan or Metal — runs fast on any OS
* Compatible with thousands of pre-trained LLMs — use any LLM in the GGUF format

### Can I export to HTML5 or iOS?

Desktop (Linux, macOS, Windows) is supported across all bindings. Android is supported on Kotlin, Godot, Flutter and React Native. iOS is supported on Swift, Flutter and React Native. visionOS and watchOS are supported via the Swift package.

Web exports will be a bit trickier to get right. See issue [#111](https://github.com/nobodywho-ooo/nobodywho/issues/111).
